189:they're reforming your government you:calm
190:don't recognize some of the same colors:calm
191:and everything from what you saw:calm
192:previously I would like to end the:calm

194:allow us to do that after what we did:calm
195:after we left so many innocents:calm
196:and witnesses during half tax Tuesday's:calm

380:ways to find army than by killing all of:suspense
381:them think of what you're doing here:suspense
382:think of what we're doing we started:suspense
383:this with the started pretty simply and:suspense
384:now it's getting out of hand it's:suspense
385:getting it very out of him is getting:suspense
386:out of hand the moment main epochs:suspense
387:popped out no you won't really got out:suspense
388:of hand Darien what I'm a freaking:suspense
389:family got murdered you think is still a:suspense
390:little mad about it yeah a little bit:suspense
391:that's only a week I don't expect you to:suspense
392:get over that fast that's all I don't I:suspense
393:don't think we should trust these men I:suspense
394:recognize that symbol and that symbol is:suspense
395:alright not why the Druids would ruin:suspense
396:one Percy was like an army what are you:suspense
397:talking about:suspense
398:are they coming here now so we've got:suspense
399:we've got word that the Army is about:suspense

401:that as a truth what would be your plan:suspense
402:each of the parties what would you plan:suspense
403:to do to wear this census it's obviously:suspense
404:happening right now the priest the heck:suspense
405:source begins to speak up and suddenly:suspense
406:llanelli the druid interrupts him just:suspense
407:before you even open his mouth and she:suspense
408:says like at first I thought piece was:suspense
409:the right direction but survival is far:suspense
410:more important I will help direct you to:suspense
411:large beasts of the wild that can aid:suspense
412:you in your cause beasts that are far:suspense
413:mightier than you are and you will be:suspense
414:able to call on their help to help:suspense
415:defend yourselves and defend your home:suspense
416:tree yeah that's my jam so again it is:suspense
417:also my favorite is she cute cuz that:suspense
418:from check 6 yeah she's extra hot but:suspense
419:you think it's probably because of a:suspense
420:spin the priest of hexed or puts his:suspense
421:staff down when he says nonsense the:suspense
422:power you will gain from a lying with us:suspense
423:as far greater than any animal in the:suspense
424:woods the power you'll gain will be:suspense
425:eternal lasting far longer than the land:suspense
426:itself you'll help your society your:suspense
427:tree your children whoever these young:suspense
428:children oki cuts them off it's like:suspense
429:listen there's army come on we need:suspense
430:specifics hustle it up man after a small:suspense
431:initiation we will help summon creatures:suspense
432:creatures that no one has ever seen:suspense
433:creatures you have never seen you know:suspense
434:it:suspense
435:I don't worship any gods but mine and:suspense
436:I'm really all about the wild beasts and:suspense
437:this is a druid lady I don't know if:suspense
438:she's single or not know if I can bring:suspense
439:it up a conversation smoothly later on:suspense
440:so sick and we will not aid you if you:suspense
441:work with them and the points the Druids:suspense
442:you can choose to follow us and work:suspense
443:with us and we will aid you I think the:suspense
444:decisions are made or we will leave and:suspense
445:reside you to your fate a fate full of:suspense
446:strife and struggle and something much:suspense
447:much more difficult than anything you:suspense
448:would ever faced working with us okay:suspense
449:you guys are citizens of this land as:suspense
450:well im a im gonna try to persuade here:suspense
451:with a 20 I beg you to to reconsider and:suspense
452:work with me and we can work together in:suspense
453:some way without us you know we can work:suspense
454:together in this one he doesn't say this:suspense
455:but I'm asking this what did you roll 17:suspense
456:and then I had a plus 3 I see perhaps we:suspense
457:will have this discussion another time:suspense
458:for a moment i considered waiting until:suspense
459:you took over the city and took over:suspense
460:this land waiting for a moment to attack:suspense
461:you once you've found complacency but we:suspense
462:respect your costs enough to the point:suspense
463:where we will step away gracefully and:suspense
464:let you continue on your cause:suspense
465:and that he whips his cloak and doing:suspense
